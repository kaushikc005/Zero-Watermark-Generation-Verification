# Zero-Watermark-Generation-Verification

The objective is to make a robust zero-watermark which once applied to an image will
make it secured with the watermark.The authenticity of the user is the utmost importance
in a watermarking scheme.

Within this project,I explored different image processing
techniques like image normalization,image binarization etc.

I used several images and watermark logos to apply to this Zero-watermaking scheme. 
In this project we implemented Zero-watermarking generation and verification for image
security.I divided the images into Low pass bands,SVD diagonal matrix,features images
and scrambled images,all of these in order to create a zero-wateramark.And this zero-
watermark is later applied to the image that needs to be watermarked.
